[[{"i":"welcome-to-goldendao","l":"Welcome to GOLDEN.DAO","p":["The Ethos of the GOLDEN.DAO can be summarized as follows: We value our people, we value decentralization, and we believe that every voice should be heard.","What does it take for a project to gain investment from the DAO? The proposals we will strongly consider all have to meet these criteria:","Promote Decentralization","Concrete Use Case in the Crypto Ecosystem","Directly Benefits the World","If a project does meet these three criteria, it will have a higher chance of passing and being funded.","However, this is not the primary goal of the DAO; we will rarely vote on projects, but instead people.","For if one is worthy and has demonstrated commitment to the cause they will be rewarded...","See subsequent sections for details on governance, staking and portfolio management."]}],[{"l":"System Overview","p":["Below is a protocol level overview of the entire ecosystem, as it is currently defined.","Overview of the system, see subsequent sections for details.","You can see the GOLD 1 token is the foundation for the entire ecosystem, specifically the 4% tax. 1% of the tax is converted directly into LP and then burned, thus ensuring the health of our foundational liquidity pool, however it is the 3% remaining that is interesting.","This 3% is sent directly to the Gold Mine and then subdivided equally; a 1% allocation going to our portfolio management fund, 1% goes to the staking protocol, and finally 1% is reserved for future endeavors."]}],[{"l":"GOLD 1","p":["This is the base token of the entire ecosystem and the main driver of treasury funds. There is a 4% tax on buys and sells via liquidity pools, and these funds are further subdivided.","1% is turned into LP and burned, allowing for the ensured growth of locked liquidity.","3% is sent directly to the Gold Mine (Treasury).","Rewards are given out in GOLD 1 from the staking system."]},{"l":"Maia","p":["If GOLD 1 is the engine of the ecosystem, the Maia token is proof of participation within it.","Maia is the token that represents a users stake in the staking contract. When a staker deposits GOLD 1, they are given Maia as proof of ownership in the system.","Once a user decides to withdraw their funds from the staking pool, the Maia is exchanged for an equivalent amount of GOLD 1."]},{"l":"Valar","p":["Valar is the token you want. It is the rarest of all tokens, and is awarded to community members that have displayed the willingness and dedication to grow the ecosystem.","Valar holders enjoy two perks. Firstly, the Valar are the only ones who can create proposals on chain. To be clear, anyone who stakes can submit ideas for consideration, but these ideas will need the backing of at least one Vala in order to become a proposal.","Secondly, the Valar split rewards from the staking pool. More on that in the staking section."]}],[{"i":"how-does-governance-work","l":"How does Governance work?","p":["As stated previously, our model of governance is centered around our community. The model can be summarized in the following points:","Only the Valar can submit proposals","Only Stakers (or holders of the Maia token) can vote on proposals","Priority is given to proposals that grow the Golden Ones community","Anyone holding the Maia token can submit ideas for proposals","This system is also summarized in the image below.","Rewards Allocation","The image above can be explained with the following flow:","keep in mind that the Maia are the stakers of Gold 1, and the Valar are the community champions, handpicked by the Golden Ones.","Both the Maia and Valar are able to propose ideas (off chain) for consideration","Only the Valar are allowed to create on chain proposals","Only the Maia are able to vote on proposals.","Upon failure, nothing happens, life goes on.","Upon success, whatever effect the proposal has comes into play."]}],[{"l":"Staking GOLD 1","p":["Staking is open to anyone who has GOLD 1, and unlocks three major benefits in the ecosystem, defined below:","Stakers receive the Maia token, enabling them to vote on proposals","Stakers earn rewards based on the Gold Mine","Stakers can propose ideas to the Valar for consideration","These three tenants also have the added benefit of taking GOLD 1 out of circulation, thus creating scarcity and price appreciation. Stakers also have a much higher chance of promotion into the Valar program."]},{"l":"Staking Mechanism","p":["The staking mechanism itself is quite standard: The amount of reward each staker receives is directly proportional to how much GOLD 1 they have staked in the pool; given by this equation:"]},{"l":"Withdrawing","p":["If you ever decide to unstake from the system, the Maia tokens you posses will be burned and exchanged for an equivalent amount of GOLD 1.","Presently there is no penalty for withdrawing, and no time limits on staking.","A full How To guide will be developed to showcase the entire staking flow as an accompaniment to the dapp."]}],[{"l":"Rewards","p":["Rewards are introduced to the system passively. When the Gold Mine has crossed the critical threshold (10 ETH) these funds are then distributed throughout the system as per the following diagram.","Rewards Allocation","In this section we will discuss the rewards based on the staking sub system. One third of the Gold Mine funds are distributed to the staking contract, and then subsequently split up again as shown above.","The Maia command a 90% split of rewards, while 10% is reserved for the Valar.","In this way the DAO is able to incentivize staking while also incentivizing business development, community building and grassroots marketing; cornerstones of a healthy project.","This multi-pronged approach will generate more proposals, which in turn will grow the staking pool. This will create greater rewards for Maia and Valar, resulting in an efficient and healthy ecosystem."]},{"l":"Valar Rewards Mechanism","p":["The 10% reward distribution for the Valar is distributed evenly amongst all Valar, such that:","As you can see, it would be wise of the Valar to be very selective on who they vote into their order, as doing so dilutes their rewards."]},{"l":"Rouge Valar Contingencies","p":["It is clear that the Valar have significant power and benefit from the system as designed. Thus, it is important to introduce a failsafe in the scenario where a Valar is acting against the benefit of the DAO.","This will either be through a blacklist, or a rescindment of the Valar token from the bad actor."]}],[{"i":"why-allocate-funds-to-portfolio-management","l":"Why Allocate funds to Portfolio Management?","p":["We have seen many DAO's rise and fall at the whim of the greater crypto community, bears and bull markets.","Our goal is to be malleable, as market resistant as possible when the bear inevitably wakes up, yet fluid enough to recognize the bull and ride the waves.","We also want to be constantly appreciating, regardless of market conditions. Based on these goals, the DAO will allocate funds to projects with the following characteristics:","Stable tokens","Yield generating assets","Native assets (ethereum)","Native asset staking","In this way we are diversifying and de-risking our portfolio, while generating yield. Down the line, a percentage of this yield could be channelled to other parts of the ecosystem, such as the staking sub-system; thus making it more attractive to stake."]},{"l":"Future Endeavors","p":["We reserve a third of the Gold Mine to be yet even more flexible to change. Undoubtedly the wise Valar and Maia will put forth ideas that are attractive to the community as a whole.","Whether by changing technology or personal merit, the DAO is designed in such a way that there are several layers of reserve funds for the future, whatever it may bring."]}]]
