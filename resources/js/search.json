[[{"i":"welcome-to-goldendao","l":"Welcome to GOLDEN.DAO","p":["Our mission is to promote decentralization. It's painfully obvious that many DAO's don't have the infrastructure required to be truly anonymous; we will change that.","We believe anyone in our ecosystem should be able to participate regardless of their position size, in short:","If you hold our token, you have the ability to create change. If you hold our token, you have the ability to vote on proposals.","What does it take for a project to gain investment from the DAO? The proposals we will strongly consider all have to meet these criteria:","Promote Decentralization","Concrete Use Case in the Crypto Ecosystem","Directly Benefits the World","If a project does meet these three criteria, it will have a higher chance of passing and being funded.","Overview of the system, see subsequent sections for details.","Once a proposal is funded, investment is granted to the proposal's investee. Once the treasury wallet is sufficiently funded, it will be emptied and distributed between the investee wallet and the rest of the ecosystem.","The investee token is then redistributed as per the proposal, with the full distribution swapped to the CULT token at the agreed rates of disbursement. E.g. once a day, week or month.","The tokens are then distributed in the following way:","50% goes to the staking pool","20% goes to holders of the new protocol token","30% is burned"]}],[{"l":"GOLD","p":["This is the base token of the entire ecosystem and the main driver of treasury funds, as there is a 3% tax on buys and sells via liquidity pools, these funds are deposited directly to the treasury wallet."]},{"l":"dGOLD","p":["If GOLD is the engine of the ecosystem, dGOLD is the proof of participation within it. dGOLD is the token that represents a users stake in the staking contract. This token is not tradeable and has no value outside of staking GOLD and serving as the voting mechanism."]},{"l":"xGOLD","p":["xGOLD is awarded to community members who have demonstrated willingness to grow the DAO. This can be in the form of marketing, business development, or the like.","Community members who are granted this special token will have a right to a percentage of the reward fund, as well as the ability to propose themselves."]}],[{"l":"Staking GOLD","p":["Staking GOLD is the basis of the whole protocol. We believe that in the spirit of decentralization and our objectives, anyone should be allowed to submit a proposal.","Upon passing, a proposal's progenitor (or investee) must deposit the agreed upon percentage of their project to the GOLDEN DAO. This percentage is split in the following ways:","50% goes to the staking pool","20% goes to holders of the new protocol token","30% is burned","In this way the DAO is able to incentivize staking while also incentivizing business development, community building and grassroots marketing; cornerstones of a healthy project.","This multi-pronged approach will generate more proposals, which in turn will grow the staking pool. This will create greater rewards for stakers and active community members, resulting in an efficient and healthy ecosystem.","A full How To guide will be developed to showcase the entire staking flow as an accompaniment to the dapp."]}],[{"l":"Rewards","p":["Overview of rewards subsystem.","Rewards are introduced to the system when a proposal successfully passes. At this point, the custodian of the proposal must convert the agreed amount of their token into GOLD, and then inject it into the protocol as defined in the image above.","As the pool grows due to successful investments, a users share will also grow. This growth is based on the percentage of dGOLD a user has.","Un-staking from the protocol will burn the dGOLD a user holds and reimburse an equivalent amount of GOLD.","The custodian (or project) then is entitled to a predetermined amount of funds from the treasury, once the treasury exceeds that threshold. In this way the proposed project gets the funds necessary to continue development, while at the same time stakers and exemplary members of the community are also rewarded."]}],[{"i":"#","p":["Please note: You cannot vote on proposals that were created before you delegated your vote.

As such, projects without third party audits from reputable firms are at a severe disadvantage.","- The burn and distribution plan - The burn and distribution plan is the vesting schedule for your protocol token. The vesting schedule can be daily, weekly, fortnightly or monthly distributions, but it cannot be vested over longer than 18 months at the very maximum.","A full How To guide will be developed to showcase the entire proposal flow as an accompaniment to the dapp."]}]]
