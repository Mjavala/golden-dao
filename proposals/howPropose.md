# Who Can Submit Proposals?

Anyone who holds dGOLD can submit a proposal. Whether a proposal passes is an entirely different matter, however we believe projects that have the following characteristics have a greater degree of successfully securing investment.

- [x] *Promote Decentralization*
- [x] *Concrete Use Case in the Crypto Ecosystem*
- [X] *Directly Benefits the World*

In short, it is the responsibility of the investee and project to convince the community that the project is worthwhile.

# What Should be Contained in A Proposal?

- [x] *Project description*
- [x] *Total supply percentage being offered in return for the DAO's investment*
- [X] *The audit of the token and any contracts if built*
- [X] *The burn and distribution plan*

**- Project description -** <br /> 
This should be self explanatory.

---

**- Total supply percentage being offered in return for the DAO's investment -** <br /> 
The DAO is deigned for pre seed and seed rounds of funding, especially if these rounds are already priced in.

---

The resulting distribution amount would then be a simple calculation; an equivalent amount to the predetermined investment the project has applied for.

---

**- The audit of the token and any contracts if built -** <br /> 
The DAO, as well as it's constituents place a high degree of value on security. As such, projects without third party audits from reputable firms are at a severe disadvantage.

---

**- The burn and distribution plan -** <br /> 
The burn and distribution plan is the vesting schedule for your protocol token. The vesting schedule can be daily, weekly, fortnightly or monthly distributions, but it cannot be vested over longer than 18 months at the very maximum.

*A full How To guide will be developed to showcase the entire proposal flow as an accompaniment to the dapp.*
