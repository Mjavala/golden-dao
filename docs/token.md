# GOLD 1
This is the base token of the entire ecosystem and the main driver of treasury funds. There is a 4% tax on buys and sells via liquidity pools, and these funds are further subdivided.

1% is turned into LP and burned, allowing for the ensured growth of locked liquidity.

3% is sent directly to the Gold Mine (Treasury).

Rewards are given out in GOLD 1 from the staking system.

## Maia
If GOLD 1 is the engine of the ecosystem, the Maia token is proof of participation within it.

Maia is the token that represents a users stake in the staking contract. When a staker deposits GOLD 1, they are given Maia as proof of ownership in the system. 

Once a user decides to withdraw their funds from the staking pool, the Maia is exchanged for an equivalent amount of GOLD 1.

## Valar
Valar is the token you want. It is the rarest of all tokens, and is awarded to community members that have displayed the willingness and dedication to grow the ecosystem.

Valar holders enjoy two perks. Firstly, the Valar are the only ones who can create proposals on chain. To be clear, anyone who stakes can submit ideas for consideration, but these ideas will need the backing of at least one Vala in order to become a proposal.

Secondly, the Valar split rewards from the staking pool. *More on that in the staking section*.
