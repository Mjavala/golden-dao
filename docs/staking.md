# Staking GOLD 1

Staking is open to anyone who has GOLD 1, and unlocks three major benefits in the ecosystem, defined below:

- [x] *Stakers receive the Maia token, enabling them to vote on proposals*
- [x] *Stakers earn rewards based on the Gold Mine*
- [x] *Stakers can propose ideas to the Valar for consideration*

These three tenants also have the added benefit of taking GOLD 1 out of circulation, thus creating scarcity and price appreciation. Stakers also have a much higher chance of promotion into the Valar program.

## Staking Mechanism
The staking mechanism itself is quite standard: The amount of reward each staker receives is directly proportional to how much GOLD 1 they have staked in the pool; given by this equation:

$$
\displaystyle {userReward = totalRewards* \frac{userShare}{totalSupply}}
$$

## Withdrawing
If you ever decide to unstake from the system, the Maia tokens you posses will be burned and exchanged for an equivalent amount of GOLD 1.

Presently there is no penalty for withdrawing, and no time limits on staking.

*A full How To guide will be developed to showcase the entire staking flow as an accompaniment to the dapp.*
