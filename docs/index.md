# Welcome to GOLDEN.DAO
The Ethos of the GOLDEN.DAO can be summarized as follows: We value our people, we value decentralization, and we believe that every voice should be heard.

What does it take for a project to gain investment from the DAO? The proposals we will strongly consider all have to meet these criteria:

- [x] *Promote Decentralization*
- [x] *Concrete Use Case in the Crypto Ecosystem*
- [X] *Directly Benefits the World*

If a project does meet these three criteria, it will have a higher chance of passing and being funded.

However, this is not the primary goal of the DAO; we will rarely vote on projects, but instead **people**. 

For if one is worthy and has demonstrated commitment to the cause they will be rewarded...

*See subsequent sections for details on governance, staking and portfolio management.*
