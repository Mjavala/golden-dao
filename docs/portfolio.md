# Why Allocate funds to Portfolio Management?

We have seen many DAO's rise and fall at the whim of the greater crypto community, bears and bull markets. 

Our goal is to be malleable, as market resistant as possible when the bear inevitably wakes up, yet fluid enough to recognize the bull and ride the waves.

We also want to be constantly appreciating, regardless of market conditions. Based on these goals, the DAO will allocate funds to projects with the following characteristics:

- [x] *Stable tokens*
- [x] *Yield generating assets*
- [x] *Native assets (ethereum)*
- [x] *Native asset staking*


In this way we are diversifying and de-risking our portfolio, while generating yield. Down the line, a percentage of this yield could be channelled to other parts of the ecosystem, such as the staking sub-system; thus making it more attractive to stake. 

## Future Endeavors
We reserve a third of the Gold Mine to be yet even more flexible to change. Undoubtedly the wise Valar and Maia will put forth ideas that are attractive to the community as a whole.

Whether by changing technology or personal merit, the DAO is designed in such a way that there are several layers of reserve funds for the future, whatever it may bring.
