# Rewards

![Overview of rewards subsystem.](/assets/rewards.png)

Rewards are introduced to the system when a proposal successfully passes. At this point, the custodian of the proposal must convert the agreed amount of their token into GOLD, and then inject it into the protocol as defined in the image above.

As the pool grows due to successful investments, a users share will also grow. This growth is based on the percentage of dGOLD a user has.

Un-staking from the protocol will burn the dGOLD a user holds and reimburse an equivalent amount of GOLD.

The custodian (or project) then is entitled to a predetermined amount of funds from the treasury, once the treasury exceeds that threshold. In this way the proposed project gets the funds necessary to continue development, while at the same time stakers and exemplary members of the community are also rewarded.
