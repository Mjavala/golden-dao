# Staking GOLD

Staking GOLD is the basis of the whole protocol. We believe that in the spirit of decentralization and our objectives, anyone should be allowed to submit a proposal. In the same vein, anyone with GOLD will be allowed to stake, there is no minimum.

Upon passing, a proposal's progenitor (or investee) must deposit the agreed upon percentage of their project to the GOLDEN DAO. This percentage is split in the following ways:

- [x] *50% goes to the staking pool*
- [x] *20% goes to holders of the new protocol token*
- [X] *30% is burned*

In this way the DAO is able to incentivize staking while also incentivizing business development, community building and grassroots marketing; cornerstones of a healthy project.

This multi-pronged approach will generate more proposals, which in turn will grow the staking pool. This will create greater rewards for stakers and active community members, resulting in an efficient and healthy ecosystem.

*A full How To guide will be developed to showcase the entire staking flow as an accompaniment to the dapp.*
